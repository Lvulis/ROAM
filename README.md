<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ROAM is to provide a computationally efficient way to
compute the Opening Angle Method for river delta shorelines. The package
also provides functionality to automatically generate an `sf` vector
geometry (i.e.Â a linestring) of the shoreline for use in RivGraph or in
a GIS.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ROAM from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Lvulis/ROAM")
```

## Example

To see how to use the package browse the package tutorial by running:
