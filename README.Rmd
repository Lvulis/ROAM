# ROAM

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ROAM is to provide a computationally efficient way to compute the Opening Angle Method for river delta shorelines. 
The package also provides functionality to automatically generate an `sf` vector geometry (i.e. a linestring) of the shoreline for use in [RivGraph](https://github.com/VeinsOfTheEarth/RivGraph) or in a GIS. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of ROAM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Lvulis/ROAM")
```

## Example

To see how to use the package browse the package tutorial by running:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
vignette('Tutorial', 'ROAM')
```
