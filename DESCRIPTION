Description: This package is used to compute the Opening Angle Method (OAM) based on Shaw et al., (2008) for river deltas. It relies on a binary water mask generated using other resources. The package workhorse is the OAM function, which is based on an OAM approximation used in Liang 2015a and the deltametrics python package. We gratefully thank John Shaw for sending a MATLAB version of this approximation.
